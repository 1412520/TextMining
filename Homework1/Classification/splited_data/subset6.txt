lgm - subject kitahara review hisatsugu kitahara elementary operation optimal derivation mit press cambridge mass page review julie legate jlegate mit edu book firmly situate within minimalist

chapter while put forth condition clear departure approach condition kitahara able account several notoriously problematic construction kitahara first chapter consist review minimalist syntactic framework discuss conceptual foundation approach unflinch application occam razor every aspect computational system guide principle global economy internal mechanism computation include creation syntactic tree through successive operation merge morphological feature driven move hbe second chapter contain core proposal book kitahara replace operation merge move erase two elementary operation concatenation replacement concatenation procedure join two object alpha beta form object replacement hand substitute object alpha object beta where beta contain within larger object sigma operation redefine elementary operation follow cyclic merge concatenation cyclic move concatenation noncyclic merge concatenation replacement noncyclic move concatenation replacement erase replacement further redefine shortest derivation condition chomsky epstein term operation ius ius shortest derivation condition sdc minimize number elementary operation necessary convergence given technology proceeds derive several principle assumption first consider cyclicity provide detail summary comparison approach chomsky derive simple case cyclic convergent derivation prefer over noncyclic convergent one

rather overt verb raise although both covert overt head movement involve one operation replacement since head movement necessarily non cyclic kitahara claim overt head movement category movement require additional instance replacement thus result longer derivation hbe reason follow verb move overtly semantic feature carry along therefore necessary delete one instance semantic feature since element interpret once require application replacement need covert movement since covert movement affect formal feature semantic feature notice same reason extend phrasal movement overt movement require one instance replacement delete semantic feature one member chain consider simple two member chain however covert movement require one instance replacement since covert movement necessarily non cyclic thus sdc cannot choose between derivation overt object shift those without predict optionality object shift language icelandic without resort optional strong feature analysis simple restatement fact language without overt verb movement object shift predict impossible assume object shift outside specifier inside specifier merge position subject multiple specifier equidistant higher head unless head movement render equidistant thus shift object block movement subject unless verb raise kitahara acknowledge however cannot explain language french display overt verb raise prohibit object shift finally kitahara consider expletive insertion notice although assume merge cheaper move kitahara reanalysis predict merge equally economical cyclic move since both consist one application concatenation since expletive insertion primary empirical motivation assumption kitahara demonstrate equally capture within system consider familiar sentence seem man room seem man room expletive insert embed spec raise matrix hand man raise embed expletive insert directly specifier matrix claim prefer over cheaper merge expletive embed move associate kitahara claim fact follow sdc since expletive assume semantic feature overt raise require application replacement delete instance semantic feature hand overt raise man require replacement delete one result two instance semantic

additional application replacement equally economical equivalent situation object shift kitahara conclude chapter two note expletive insertion icelandic transitive expletive construction assume
