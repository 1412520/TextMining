weitergabe von daten werden die meisten niederschriften von buechern artikeln diplom und magisterarbeiten bereit heute durch textverarbeitungsprogramme bearbeitet und liegen letztendlich eine dateus vor neue und schnellere rechner sowie leistungsfaehigere programme machen neben der bearbeitung von text auch mehr und mehr eine integration von bildern bildsequenzen und tonaufnahman eine

artikulierenden organe wie mund und unterkiefer damit ist diese experiment besser nachvollziehbar und koennte unter anderen gesichtspunkten von dritten wissenschaftlern ebenfall durchgefuehrt werden ist moeglich vielen faellen neben den ausfuehrungen einer untersuchung auch den untersuchungsgegenstand auf einen datentraeger speichern diese mengen daten die durch die kombination von text bild und
