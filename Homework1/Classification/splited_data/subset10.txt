vieler wissenschaftler durch die einfuehrung moderner techniken der datenverarbeitung grundlegend geaendert fast jeder arbeitsplatz ist mit einem computer ausgestattet der nach einigen geduldigen stunden und tagen kennenlernen der wirkungsweise dieser geraete einen enorman arbeitsvorteil darstellt dieser vorteil besteht insbesondere der mehr und mehr komfortableren erfassung verarbeitung und weitergabe von daten werden die meisten niederschriften von buechern artikeln diplom und magisterarbeiten bereit heute durch textverarbeitungsprogramme bearbeitet und liegen letztendlich eine dateus vor neue und schnellere rechner sowie leistungsfaehigere programme machen neben der bearbeitung von text auch mehr und mehr eine integration von bildern bildsequenzen und tonaufnahman eine niederschrift moeglich kann eine phonetische niederschrift ueber ein lautsprachlich experiment neben den schriftlichen ausfuehrungen auch die sprachaufnahman enthalten aber auch bildaufnahman der artikulierenden organe wie mund und unterkiefer damit ist diese experiment besser nachvollziehbar und koennte unter anderen gesichtspunkten von dritten wissenschaftlern ebenfall durchgefuehrt werden ist moeglich vielen faellen neben den ausfuehrungen einer untersuchung auch den untersuchungsgegenstand auf einen datentraeger speichern diese mengen daten die durch die kombination von text bild und ton entstehen archivieren bewaehrt sich immer mehr die speichermedium viele veroeffentlichungen erscheinen schon heute auf neben der moeglichkeit einer multus medium darstellung von wissen hat die aber noch einen weiteren vorteil aufgrund der niedrigen herstellungskosten einer und der riesigen menge speicherplatz wird moeglich publikationen von mehr wissenschaftlern veroeffentlichen mit

bedingt durch preal und chancenlosigkeit eher der schublade verschwanden mit diesem hintergrund versehen wuerde ich gern eine umfrage starten inwieweit linguisten aller gebiete ein interesse folgenden theman zeigen gibt eine allgemeine akzeptanz der multus medium technik greifen linguisten lieber auf traditionell gedruckte literatur zurueck oder besteht auch ein interesse der wissensaufnahme durch

publikation von wissenschaftlichen arbeiten wer hat schon erfahrungen der sprachwissenschaftlichen anwendung von gesammelt diese umfrage steht dienst einer konzeptentwicklung fuer ein neu unternehman
