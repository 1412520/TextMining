weitergabe von daten werden die meisten niederschriften von buechern artikeln diplom und magisterarbeiten bereit heute durch textverarbeitungsprogramme bearbeitet und liegen letztendlich eine dateus vor neue und schnellere rechner sowie leistungsfaehigere programme machen neben der bearbeitung von text auch mehr und mehr eine integration von bildern bildsequenzen und tonaufnahman eine
